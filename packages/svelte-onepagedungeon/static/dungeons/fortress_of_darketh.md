# Fortress of Darketh

_Since the death of Darketh the fortress has changed hands many times. Lately a pack of blood-sucking goats have made its lair here._

1. A rear entrance into the fortress.
2. A stuffed human with a key in their hands.
3. An unholy staff among rubble on the ground.
4. A lavishly decorated door with two keyholes on the northern wall.
5. A ticking clockwork machine, allows a person to breath under water when the lever is pulled.
6. A basket with a scarf.
7. A rotten chest holds a key.
