# Chambers of the Red Master

_Long after the Red Master's demise the chambers remained deserted. These days they are badly infested by ants, which don't care about the past of the place._

1. A rear entrance into the chambers.
2. A box with an iron key in it.
3. A corpse of a human, an iron key close to it.
4. An iron key hovering in the middle of the hall.
5. A rapier of smiting among rubble on the ground.
6. An iron key in a large chest.
7. A lavishly decorated wooden gate with four keyholes on the northern wall of the large chamber.
8. A fresco on the ceiling, makes a person hallucinate when looked at.
9. A teenager. Would like to hire you for a job.
