# Veiled Halls of the Fire Baron

1. A rear entrance into the halls.
2. A pile of rubble hides some gold and a scale mail.
3. A crate holds a strange, unnaturally heavy tiara.
4. A corpse of a dwarf, rations close by.
5. A scorched double door with two keyholes to the south.
6. A blade of health hovering in the middle of the small chamber.
7. A battered basket with a key in it.
8. A key in the middle of a pentagram on the ground.
