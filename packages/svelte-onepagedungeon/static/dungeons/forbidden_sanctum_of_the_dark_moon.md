# Forbidden Sanctum of the Dark Moon

_After being destroyed by a horrible fire a millenium ago the sanctum remained abandoned. These days it is infested by scorpions. Word is that countless treasures of ancient books and gold and jewels are stored here._

1. A rear entrance into the sanctum.
2. Some gold at the bottom of a small pool.
3. A rotten chest holds gems.
4. A lavishly decorated gate with two keyholes to the south.
5. A key locked in a magical safe.
6. A key in a trunk.
