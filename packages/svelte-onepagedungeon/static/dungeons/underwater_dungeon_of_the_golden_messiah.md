# Underwater Dungeon of the Golden Messiah

_The Golden Messiah is long dead, but people are still reluctant to come close to the dungeon. Lately a terrifying basilisk has made its home here. The dungeon of the Golden Messiah is home to a rare species of bloom._

1. A stuffed dwarf artificer with a mysterious, ice-cold cloak in their hands.
2. A lavishly decorated door to the south.
3. A sellsword, tightly tied to a stake.
4. A rear entrance into the dungeon. A pile of rubble hides an uncanny, unnaturally heavy dagger.
5. A mutilated body of a goblin, a flail of vengeance and lockpicks close by.
