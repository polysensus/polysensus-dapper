# Haunted Mausoleum of the Blasphemous One

_Since the defeat of the Blasphemous One the mausoleum has changed hands many times. Lately a pack of wyverns have made its home here. It is said that untold treasures of magical artifacts and ancient books can be found here._

1. A round iron gate with a keyhole to the north.
2. A shield among rubble on the ground.
3. A lifelike sculpture of a gnome, a weird tablet of unknown material in its hands.
4. A rear entrance into the mausoleum. A corpse of a hobgoblin, a key nearby.
5. A large chest with an enchanted spear, a torch and some gold in it.
6. A creepy slim knight, sleeping in a corner.
7. A floor mirror, makes a person smaller when looked in.
