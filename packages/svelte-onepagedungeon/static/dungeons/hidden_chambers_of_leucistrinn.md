# Hidden Chambers of Leucistrinn

_The chambers of Leucistrinn are situated high in the Bryseis mountains. Lately an undead hydra has made its home here. The chambers of Leucistrinn are home to a valuable species of mushroom._

1. Remains of a cultist apparently killed by humans, a weird, smoking pin clutched in his hands.
2. A relief depicting a handsome elf.
3. A great ironbound gate with a keyhole on the northern wall.
4. A child. Needs help to get out from the chambers.
5. A rear entrance into the chambers. A mantle and a mace hidden in a crack of the wall.
