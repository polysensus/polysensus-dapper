# Hidden Palace of the Cursed Reaper

_For decades the palace of the Cursed Reaper was considered lost. Currently it is badly infested by crows._

1. A stuffed elf hunter with a strange, unnaturally light object in their hands.
2. A slime-covered body of a human, a mysterious, whispering helm close by.
3. A large strongbox holds some gold, a breastplate and a scimitar.
4. A round gate to the east.
5. A mysterious gnome, sitting on the ground.
6. A mosaic of a fish pattern on the ceiling
7. A rear entrance into the palace.
8. A bottomless well, bursts into flames if a coin is dropped into it.
