# Swamp Catacombs of the Golden Knight

_Long after the Golden Knight's fall the catacombs remained deserted. Lately a gang of gnolls rediscovered them._

1. A lamp, some gold and a rapier of smiting at the bottom of a pool.
2. A reinforced trunk holds a star-shaped key.
3. A gnoll, talking to an invisible friend.
4. A stuffed elf druid with a tarot deck of illusions in their hands.
5. A star-shaped key in a basket.
6. A mold-covered body of a gnome, gems nearby.
7. A sign on the wall painted in blood: REVEAL YOUR INNER WASP
8. A large double door with two keyholes to the east.
9. A suspicious shaman, resting on the ground.
10. A mosaic of a star pattern on the ceiling
11. A wooden altar, tells an unwanted truth when a sacrifice is made.
12. A creepy doll, drives a person mad when picked up.
