# Forsaken Asylum of the Scarlet Dragon

_For a long time the asylum of the Scarlet Dragon remained abandoned. These days it is infested by wasps, which don't care about the past of the place._

1. A round wooden gate with a keyhole to the east.
2. A large pile of rubble hides a brass key.
3. A battered chest with an uncanny, sticky javelin in it.
4. A ticking gearwork machine, allows a person to breath under water when the lever is pulled.
5. A magic scroll in the middle of a circle of runes on the ground.
