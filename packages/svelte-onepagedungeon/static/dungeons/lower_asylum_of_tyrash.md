# Lower Asylum of Tyrash

_Long after Tyrash's defeat the asylum remained uninhabited. Lately an undead wyvern has made its home here._

1. A reinforced basket with a lamp in it.
2. A dwarf. Pleads to borrow rations.
3. A key tucked under some debris.
4. A weird, unnaturally heavy object hovering in the middle of the hall.
5. A huge wooden door with three keyholes to the north.
6. An enormous crystal, puts a person to sleep if struck hard.
7. A dying elf, a key among his belongings.
8. A box holds a key.
