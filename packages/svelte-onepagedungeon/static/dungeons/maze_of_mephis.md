# Maze of Mephis

_Long after Mephis's death the maze remained uninhabited. These days it is overrun with pigs, indifferent to the history of the place. Rumors say that untold treasures of magical artifacts are stored here._

1. Lockpicks at the bottom of a small pool.
2. An eye preserved in a jar, turns out to be a mimic when shaken.
3. A brash druid. Can be convinced to help you in your mission.
4. A great iron door with a keyhole to the south.
5. A basket with a leather armor and some gold.
6. A dying human, a bronze ring among his belongings.
7. A rotten chest holds a key.
8. A gem of binding hovering in the middle of the small chamber.
