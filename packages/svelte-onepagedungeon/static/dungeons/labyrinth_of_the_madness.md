# Labyrinth of the Madness

_The labyrinth is situated deep in the dense jungle, far from the nearest town. These days it is overrun with pigs. Rumors say that a legendary looking glass Kori-Kyra is hidden here._

1. An old lady, resting on the ground.
2. A statue of a dwarf, tells a story of the labyrinth when touched.
3. A reinforced crate with a key.
4. A strange, vibrating chainmail on a pedestal.
5. A mosaic of an arrow pattern on the floor
6. A sign on the wall painted in blood: PIRANHAS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM
7. A bard. Wants to pay you to get rid of an uncanny, slightly humming idol.
8. A scorched ironbound double door with a keyhole on the southern wall.
9. A fire in a brazier, bursts into flames when touched.
