# Stronghold of Arash-Eketh

_For decades the stronghold of Arash-Eketh remained sealed. Now it is controlled by a gang of hobgoblins._

1. A crate holds a weird bracelet of unknown material.
2. A rear entrance into the stronghold. A statue of a hobgoblin, tells a story of this place when touched.
3. An uncanny, ice-cold dagger on a pedestal.
4. A huge stone door to the north.
5. A rotten chest containing a rusty mace and some gold.
