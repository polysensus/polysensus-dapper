# Underground Hall of the Black Savant

_After the fall of the Black Savant the hall has changed hands many times. Currently it is infested by rhinos, which don't care about the past of the place._

1. A huge ironclad gate with a keyhole on the western wall.
2. A trunk containing an iron key.
3. A rear entrance into the hall.
4. A rusty clockwork machine, allows a person to see in darkness when the lever is pulled.
5. A broken chest holds a bottle of wine and an enchanted scimitar.
