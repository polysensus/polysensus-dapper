# Veiled Manor of the Viper One

_For a long time the manor of the Viper One was considered lost. These days it is overrun with lizards, which don't care about the past of the place. Word is that untold treasures of magical artifacts are stored here._

1. A rear entrance into the manor.
2. A key in a glass trophy case.
3. A noble, lying in a corner.
4. A mouth-shaped ironclad gate with three keyholes to the west.
5. A chest holds a key.
6. A key in a reinforced crate.
7. A crowbar and a rusty axe among rubble on the ground.
8. A frozen body of a gnome, gems close by.
