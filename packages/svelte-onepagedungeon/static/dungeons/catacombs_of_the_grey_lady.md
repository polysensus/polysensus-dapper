# Catacombs of the Grey Lady

_For a millenium the catacombs of the Grey Lady remained sealed. Lately a terrifying basilisk has made its home here._

1. A battered gate to the north.
2. A hooded figure, resting on the ground.
3. A battered trunk containing a chainmail and lockpicks.
4. A rear entrance into the catacombs. A statue of a snake, turns out to be a mimic when touched.
5. A mutilated body of a human, a sword, a torch and a helm nearby.
6. A large pile of rubble hides some gold.
7. Gems in a strongbox.
