# Darkmoon Asylum

_For years the asylum was considered lost. Lately a party of bandits rediscovered it, making it their headquarters._

1. A pile of rubble hides candles and some gold.
2. A dying halfling, gems among his belongings.
3. A sword in a medium crate.
4. A great ironbound gate on the eastern wall.
5. A rear entrance into the asylum.
6. A giant stuffed beast, wails loudly when stroked.
