# Lost Dungeon of Kyrakis

_After being destroyed in a horrible battle years ago the dungeon of Kyrakis remained uninhabited. Recently it was squatted by a band of cultists. The dungeon of Kyrakis is home to a highly valued species of berry._

1. A mosaic of a bird pattern on the ceiling
2. A battered gate with a keyhole to the south.
3. A sculpture of a gnome bard, a mysterious, unnaturally heavy breastplate in its hands.
4. A crate containing some gold.
5. A lamp and a blood-stained flail hidden in a crack of the wall.
6. A medium chest holds a silver key.
7. Remains of a druid apparently killed by cultists, an uncanny dice covered with carvings clutched in his hands.
