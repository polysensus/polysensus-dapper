# Abbey of the Great Witch

_For years the abbey of the Great Witch was considered lost. Currently it is infested by beasts. Word is that a legendary skull Lech-Modlor is hidden here._

1. Some gold and a cursed flail in a crate.
2. A massive double door to the west.
3. A broken locker containing a breastplate.
4. A wild-haired artificer. Desperately needs help.
