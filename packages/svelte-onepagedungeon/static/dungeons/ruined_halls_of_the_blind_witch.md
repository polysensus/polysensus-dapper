# Ruined Halls of the Blind Witch

_The halls of the Blind Witch are situated at a bend of the river Silverspear. Lately a gang of kobolds rediscovered them._

1. A battered door on the southern wall.
2. Lockpicks in a medium crate.
3. A short gnome. Would like to join you for a reward.
4. Remains of a monk, a strange, unnaturally light object in his hands.
5. A chest holds a chainmail and some gold.
6. A sculpture of an elf hunter, a censer of magic missile in its hands.
7. A dusty book on a lectern, wails loudly when opened.
8. A mosaic of an arrow pattern on the floor
9. A dwarf, sleeping on the ground.
10. A rusty clockwork machine, makes a person forget his name when the lever is pulled.
