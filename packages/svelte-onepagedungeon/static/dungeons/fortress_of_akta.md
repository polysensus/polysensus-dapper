# Fortress of Akta

_After the defeat of Akta the fortress has changed hands many times. Recently a party of hobgoblins rediscovered it._

1. A huge double door with two keyholes on the northern wall of the room.
2. An orb of haunting hovering in the middle of the chamber.
3. A chest containing a strange, sticky grimoire.
4. A half-eaten body of a hobgoblin, a breastplate close to it.
5. A sarcastic sad-eyed human, whistling tunelessly.
6. A giant pile of rubble hides a copper key.
7. A map and some gold at the bottom of a pool.
8. A copper key in a battered strongbox.
9. A rear entrance into the fortress. A chest with gems.
10. Remains of a warlock apparently killed by gnomes, a vorpal axe and a halberd clutched in his hands.
