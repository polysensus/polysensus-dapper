# Palace of the Fear

_After being destroyed in a great battle years ago the palace remained deserted. Lately a pack of hydras have made its lair here._

1. Gems tucked under some debris.
2. An artist, sitting in a corner.
3. A stuffed elf shaman with an iron key in their hands.
4. Remains of a dwarf, an iron key in his hands.
5. A weird, unnaturally light scale mail in the middle of a circle of runes on the ground.
6. A huge stone door with four keyholes on the eastern wall.
7. A crate containing an iron key.
8. A medium box with a javelin and a chainmail.
9. A corpse of a goblin, an iron key close to it.
