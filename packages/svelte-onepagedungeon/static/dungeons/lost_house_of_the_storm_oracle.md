# Lost House of the Storm Oracle

_The house of the Storm Oracle is situated on a remote island. Lately a pack of mutant snakes have made its home here._

1. A lichen-covered body of a cultist, gems close by.
2. A rear entrance into the house. A scarf and a long sword tucked under some debris.
3. A great gate with a keyhole to the north.
4. A statue of a gnome, teleports a person outside the house when touched.
5. A weird, vibrating chain on a pedestal.
6. A silver key in a reinforced chest.
7. A graffiti depicting the landscape around the house.
