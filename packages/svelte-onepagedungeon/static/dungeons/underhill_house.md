# Underhill House

_After being destroyed in a horrible battle decades ago the house remained deserted. These days it is badly infested by beasts, which don't care about the past of the place._

1. A rear entrance into the house. A massive door to the south.
2. Remains of a halfling, a scale mail, some gold and lockpicks clutched in his hands.
3. A jeweled throne, allows a person to breath under water when sat on.
4. A medium crate holds a hammer of smiting.
5. A magic statuette in a chest.
