# Prison of the Black General

_For a long time the prison of the Black General was considered lost. Lately a gang of orcs rediscovered it, making it their headquarters._

1. A rear entrance into the prison.
2. A box holds a copper key.
3. A mysterious, unnaturally heavy medallion locked in a safe.
4. A mosaic of a bat pattern on the ceiling
5. An old lady, resting on the ground.
6. A massive gate with three keyholes on the western wall.
7. A copper key in a battered trunk.
8. A pile of rubble hides a copper key.
9. A fresco on the wall, ages a person when looked at.
