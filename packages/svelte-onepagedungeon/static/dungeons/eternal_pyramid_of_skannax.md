# Eternal Pyramid of Skannax

_After the fall of Skannax the pyramid has changed hands many times. Recently a giant wyrm has made its home here. Rumors say that a legendary carpet Azzakra-Ora is hidden here._

1. A stuffed gnome with a strange, glowing grimoire in their hands.
2. A brash dwarf, sleeping in a corner.
3. A lavishly decorated gate to the south.
4. A mosaic of an eye pattern on the ceiling
5. A regular spear and a torch in a battered chest.
6. A mural on the wall, turns out to be a mimic when examined.
7. A locker with an enchanted skull in it.
