# Keep of the Purple Messiah

_For a millenium the keep of the Purple Messiah was considered lost. Currently it is badly infested by crows._

1. A rear entrance into the keep.
2. A key in a rotten crate.
3. A box containing some gold.
4. A stuffed elf barbarian with a key in their hands.
5. A dying wizard, a bottle of wine and a robe among his belongings.
6. A hooded human, sleeping on the ground.
7. A round gate with two keyholes to the east.
8. The chamber is filled with dense smoke. It pleads to be killed when inhaled.
