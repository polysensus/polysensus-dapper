# Abandoned Palace of the Obsidian Reaper

_The palace of the Obsidian Reaper is situated deep in the jungle, protected by the harsh weather. Currently it is infested by monkeys. It is rumored that the palace is rich with gold and jewels and magical artifacts._

1. A huge stone double door on the northern wall of the hall.
2. A rear entrance into the palace. A holy scroll in a magically locked curio case.
3. A desiccated body of a bandit, a mysterious, unnaturally heavy scarf close by.
