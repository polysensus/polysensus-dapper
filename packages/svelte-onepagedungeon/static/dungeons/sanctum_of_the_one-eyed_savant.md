# Sanctum of the One-eyed Savant

_For many years the sanctum of the One-eyed Savant was considered lost. Currently it is overrun with monkeys, which don't care about the history of the place._

1. A mouth-shaped ironbound double door with two keyholes to the west.
2. A rear entrance into the sanctum.
3. A silver key tucked under some debris.
4. A stuffed boar, tells where a treasure is hidden when stroked.
5. A rotten chest containing some gold.
6. A silver key hovering in the middle of the small chamber.
7. A polite gnome, sitting in a corner.
