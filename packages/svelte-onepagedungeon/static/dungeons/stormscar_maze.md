# Stormscar Maze

_The maze is situated on a lonely island. Recently a terrifying chimera has made its lair here._

1. A large wooden gate to the north.
2. A painting, totally destroyed by fire.
3. A strongbox containing an enchanted spear.
4. A mysterious book covered with glyphs in a shattered trophy case.
5. A corpse of a halfling, a strange, translucent brooch close by.
6. A smuggler, resting in a corner.
7. A rear entrance into the maze. A stuffed spider, wails loudly when stroked.
