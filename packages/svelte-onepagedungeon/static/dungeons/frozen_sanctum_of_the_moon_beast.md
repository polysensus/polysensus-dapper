# Frozen Sanctum of the Moon Beast

_For many years the sanctum of the Moon Beast was considered lost. Lately an undead manticore has made its home here. The sanctum of the Moon Beast is a place of growth of a highly valued species of bloom._

1. A rear entrance into the sanctum.
2. A large chest with a leather armor, some gold and a torch.
3. A glaive in a basket.
4. A scorched double door to the south.
5. A sculpture of a halfling artificer, a weird, unnaturally heavy halberd in its hands.
6. A sign on the wall painted in blood: DEATH TO KOBOLDS
7. A sarcastic barbarian, sitting on the ground.
