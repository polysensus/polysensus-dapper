# Lower Citadel of the Moon Prince

_Long after the Moon Prince's fall the citadel remained abandoned. Lately an undead dragon has made its lair here. Word is that untold treasures of magical artifacts and ancient books are stored here._

1. A mouth-shaped double door to the south.
2. A wizard, resting in a corner.
3. A knife of resurrection at the bottom of a small pool.
4. Some gold in a box.
5. A tapestry on the wall, makes a person forget his name when brushed.
6. A dying orc, a crowbar, a vorpal mace and a shield among his belongings.
7. A painting depicting the landscape around the citadel.
8. A strange, whispering halberd locked in a magical safe.
