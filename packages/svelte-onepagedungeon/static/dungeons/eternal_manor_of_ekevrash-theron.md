# Eternal Manor of Ekevrash-Theron

_For several centuries the manor of Ekevrash-Theron remained sealed. Lately it was squatted by a gang of pirates._

1. A great door on the northern wall.
2. A stuffed elf with a pin of blasting in their hands.
3. A corpse of a druid, some gold, a rusty katana and arrows close by.
4. A pirate. Pleads to borrow a lamp.
5. A mysterious, unnaturally heavy scale mail hidden in a crack of the wall.
6. A painting on the wall, totally destroyed by pirate vandals.
7. A large crate with a magic rod in it.
8. A trunk holds a chainmail.
9. A graffiti depicting a scene of celebration.
10. A rear entrance into the manor. A quiet dwarf, sitting on the ground.
11. A creepy doll, transforms a person into a pirate when picked up.
