# Observatory of the Serpent Savant

_The observatory of the Serpent Savant is situated on a remote island. These days it is overrun with cats._

2. A skinless body of a human, a strange, translucent helm close to it.
3. A chest holds a key.
4. A medium crate with a long sword and a scarf.
5. A carving depicting the Serpent Savant.
6. A massive ironbound door with a keyhole to the east.
7. A stone altar, swears when a sacrifice is made.
8. A giant pile of rubble hides some gold.
9. A knight. Has a quest for you.
