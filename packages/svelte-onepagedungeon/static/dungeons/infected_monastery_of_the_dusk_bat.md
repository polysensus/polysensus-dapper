# Infected Monastery of the Dusk Bat

_For decades the monastery was considered lost. Recently a pack of fire-breathing pigeons have made its home here. It is said that untold treasures of magical artifacts and gold and jewels are stored here._

1. A strongbox with a bat-shaped key.
2. A bat-shaped key hidden in a crack of the wall.
3. A carving on the wall, totally destroyed by fire.
4. A rear entrance into the monastery. A dying kobold, an ivory dice among his belongings.
5. A mouth-shaped gate with two keyholes on the western wall.
6. An artist, checking the content of a medium trunk.
7. A mundane-looking door, wails loudly when the knob is touched.
