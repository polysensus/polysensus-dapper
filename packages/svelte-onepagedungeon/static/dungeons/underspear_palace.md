2. A fresco on the wall, totally destroyed by orc vandals.
3. A gnome, lying in ambush.
4. A dying elf, a relic of frost among his belongings.

6. A puddle of murky water, makes a person slightly bigger when drank from.
7. A rotten locker holds a breastplate.
8. A crate containing a jeweled necklace.
