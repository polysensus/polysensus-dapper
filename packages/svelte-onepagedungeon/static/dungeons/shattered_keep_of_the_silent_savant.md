# Shattered Keep of the Silent Savant

_For a long time the keep of the Silent Savant remained sealed. Currently it is overrun with wolfs, which don't care about the past of the place._

1. A pile of rubble hides a crowbar.
2. Remains of an orc, some gold and an ornate dagger in his hands.
3. A broken chest containing a key.
4. A weird, ice-cold looking glass hovering in the middle of the small chamber.
5. A key in a box.
6. A magic compass at the bottom of a pool.
7. A rotten strongbox holds a key.
8. A crate with a key.
9. A notable wooden door with four keyholes to the west.
10. A rear entrance into the keep.
11. A brain preserved in a jar, makes a person forget his name when shaken.
