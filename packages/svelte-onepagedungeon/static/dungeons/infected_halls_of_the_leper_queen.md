# Infected Halls of the Leper Queen

_Long after the Leper Queen's demise the halls remained deserted. Lately a gang of orcs rediscovered them, making them their center of operation. Rumors say that untold treasures of ancient books are stored here._

1. A rear entrance into the halls.
2. A druid, lying on the ground.
3. A reinforced locker with a breastplate, a scale mail and some gold.
4. A carving on the wall, totally destroyed by fire.
5. A crate containing a rapier and some gold.
6. A slime-covered body of a halfling, a map of the halls nearby.
7. A mouth-shaped double door to the north.
8. A silver dice at the bottom of a pool.
9. A stuffed gnome with a looking glass of haunting in their hands.
