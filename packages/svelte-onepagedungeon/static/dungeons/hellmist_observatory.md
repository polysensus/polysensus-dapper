# Hellmist Observatory

_The observatory is situated deep in the snowy plains, protected by the dangerous local fauna and impassable terrain. Recently a huge invisible spider has made its lair here. The observatory is home to a rare specie of fungi._

5. A key at the bottom of a pool.
6. A broken crate containing a key.
7. A trunk holds lockpicks and some gold.
