# Ruined Dungeon of the Iron Bat

_The dungeon is situated at the center of a lake. Recently it was squatted by a band of hobgoblins._

1. An uncanny, slightly glowing spear on a pedestal table.
2. A large pile of rubble hides a staff and some gold.
3. A great wooden double door on the western wall of the small chamber.
4. A rope in a broken crate.
5. A rear entrance into the dungeon. A brain preserved in a jar, makes a person bigger when shaken.
