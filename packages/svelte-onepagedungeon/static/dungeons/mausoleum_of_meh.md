# Mausoleum of Meh

_After being destroyed by a devastating flood a millenium ago the mausoleum of Meh remained uninhabited. Lately a huge fire-breathing bear has made its lair here._

2. A giant pile of rubble hides some gold and candles.
3. A broken trunk holds a jewel-encrusted comb.
4. A mysterious, vibrating object locked in a magical safe.
5. A crate containing a key.
6. Remains of a wizard apparently killed by halflings, a scale mail clutched in his hands.
7. A statue of a human, makes a person forget his name when touched.
8. A lavishly decorated iron gate with a keyhole on the northern wall of the chamber.
9. A soldier, muttering gibberish.
10. An elf, sitting in a corner.
11. A writing on the wall: WHERE IN HELL IS MY DAMNED SHIELD
12. A mosaic of a skull pattern on the ceiling
