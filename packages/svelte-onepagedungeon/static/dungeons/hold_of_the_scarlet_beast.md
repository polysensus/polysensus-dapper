# Hold of the Scarlet Beast

_Since the demise of the Scarlet Beast the hold has changed hands many times. Recently a pack of fire-breathing rhinos have made its lair here. It is said that countless treasures of ancient books and magical artifacts are stored here._

1. A weird chainmail of unknown material locked in a safe.
2. Arrows and a staff of slaying hidden in a crevice of the floor.
3. A chest with a leather armor in it.
4. A round door to the east.
5. A stuffed owl, tells an unwanted truth when stroked.
6. A reinforced chest containing gems.
7. A rear entrance into the hold. A teenager, lying in a corner.
8. Remains of a bandit apparently killed by elves, some gold and some gold clutched in his hands.
9. A still warm body of a dwarf, a magic bracelet close by.
