# Forbidden Den of the Storm Master

_Since the death of the Storm Master the den has changed hands many times. Recently a band of goblins rediscovered it._

1. A round iron gate with a keyhole to the north.
2. A corpse of an elf, gems close by.
3. A potion of resistence among rubble on the ground.
4. A broken crate with some gold, a scarf and an ancient katana in it.
5. A trunk holds a key.
6. A mysterious, unnaturally heavy halberd hovering in the middle of the small chamber.
7. A suspicious door, makes a person slightly bigger when the knob is touched.
