# Tomb of Death Cross

_After being destroyed in a great battle centuries ago the tomb remained deserted. Currently it is badly infested by rabbits, which don't care about the past of the place. Word is that Shedinn-Phelaios, a legendary flute, is still hidden here._

1. A chest holds a key.
2. A carving on the wall depicting the land around the tomb as it looked in the distant past.
3. A rear entrance into the tomb. A battered double door with two keyholes on the eastern wall.
4. A battered basket with an enchanted rod.
5. A lifelike sculpture of an elf, a key in its hands.
6. A pile of rubble hides some gold.
