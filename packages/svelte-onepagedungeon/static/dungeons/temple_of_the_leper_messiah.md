# Temple of the Leper Messiah

_The temple of the Leper Messiah is situated on a lonely island. Currently it is overrun with ants._

1. A mouth-shaped gate with a keyhole on the eastern wall.
2. A crowbar among rubble on the ground.
3. An uncanny, sticky leather armor in a trophy case.
4. A rear entrance into the temple.
5. A dying ranger, a staff and some gold among his belongings.
6. A teenager. Wants to join you.
7. An iron key in a battered chest.
