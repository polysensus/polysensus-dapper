# Grimscar Manor

_For many years the manor was considered lost. These days it is overrun with apes._

1. A large stone gate with a keyhole on the southern wall of the room.
2. A puddle of water, turns into dust when drank from.
3. A scarf and some gold in a chest.
4. An ancient halberd tucked under some debris.
5. Remains of a barbarian apparently killed by cultists, a jewel-encrusted statuette clutched in his hands.
6. A reinforced box holds a snail-shaped key.
7. A rear entrance into the manor. A soldier, locked in a cage.
