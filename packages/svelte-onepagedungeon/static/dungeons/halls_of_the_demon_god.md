# Halls of the Demon God

_For several centuries the halls of the Demon God were considered lost. Recently a giant mutant ape has made its lair here._

1. A round double door to the north.
2. Remains of a thief apparently killed by kobolds, some gold and a scale mail in his hands.
3. A basket containing gems.
4. A girl, shaking out of fear.
5. A reinforced crate with a vorpal glaive.
