# Swamp Crypt of Magtherinn

_Long after Magtherinn's defeat the crypt remained uninhabited. Currently it is infested by wereturtles, which don't care about the past of the place. It is rumored that untold treasures of magical artifacts are stored here._

1. An uncanny, slightly vibrating box hovering in the middle of the hall.
2. An enchanted hammer among rubble on the ground.
3. A silver key in a chest.
4. A corpse of a halfling, a silver key nearby.
5. A mosaic of a bat pattern on the floor
6. A reinforced chest containing a torch and a mantle.
7. A broken strongbox with a silver key.
8. A dwarf. Wants to pay you to get rid of a strange, ice-cold flute.
9. A giant pile of rubble hides a mysterious, whispering helm.
10. A relief depicting the landscape around the crypt as it looked in the distant past.
11. A scorched door with three keyholes on the eastern wall.
12. A giant stuffed wasp, animates when stroked.
