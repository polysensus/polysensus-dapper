# Abandoned Halls of the White King

_After being destroyed by a terrible arcane disaster decades ago the halls of the White King remained deserted. Lately a giant wyvern has made its home here. It is rumored that Na, a legendary chess piece, is hidden here._

1. A massive gate with a keyhole to the south.
2. A stuffed elf artificer with a coin of force in their hands.
3. An explorer. Can be convinced to help you in your mission.
4. Remains of a human apparently killed by dwarves, a key clutched in his hands.
5. A rear entrance into the halls. A pile of rubble hides a scimitar of lightning and some gold.
6. A burning fire in a brazier, turns out to be a mimic when touched.
7. A writing on the wall: NO MORE TERROR
8. A box with a breastplate.
