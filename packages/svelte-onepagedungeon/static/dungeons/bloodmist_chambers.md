# Bloodmist Chambers

_For a long time the chambers were considered lost. Now they are controlled by a party of thugs. The chambers are a place of growth of a highly valued species of herb._

1. An old dwarf. Has an axe of life stealing for trade.
2. A scorched iron door with a keyhole to the north.
3. A rotten chest with a scarf and some gold.
4. A key hidden in a crack of the floor.
5. A crystalized body of a thug, a golden figurine close by.
6. A mysterious javelin of unknown material hovering in the middle of the chamber.
