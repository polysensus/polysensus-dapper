# Twilight Basilica of Pelmos

_For centuries the basilica of Pelmos remained sealed. Lately it was squatted by a party of cultists. The basilica of Pelmos is home to a valuable species of plant._

1. A medium chest containing a breastplate and some gold.
2. A key tucked under some debris.
3. A great iron gate with a keyhole on the northern wall.
4. A dying cultist, a scimitar among his belongings.
5. A lifelike statue of a human artificer, a weird, sticky mace in its hands.
6. A rear entrance into the basilica. A crate holds gems.
