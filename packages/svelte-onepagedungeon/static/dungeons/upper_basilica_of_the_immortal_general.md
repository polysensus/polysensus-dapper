# Upper Basilica of the Immortal General

_For a long time the basilica of the Immortal General was considered lost. Now it is controlled by a party of goblins._

1. A battered ironclad double door to the north.
2. Gems in a basket.
3. A rear entrance into the basilica.
4. A calm large knight, sleeping on the ground.
5. A dying goblin, some gold and a shield among his belongings.
