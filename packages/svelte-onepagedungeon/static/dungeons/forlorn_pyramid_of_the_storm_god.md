# Forlorn Pyramid of the Storm God

_Long after the Storm God's defeat the pyramid remained deserted. Lately a giant soul-sucking rabbit has made its home here._

1. A regular staff in a large basket.
2. A creepy doll, spawns a book of protection when picked up.
3. A lavishly decorated gate with a keyhole on the eastern wall.
4. A crate holds a cloak, a rope and some gold.
5. A ranger. Can be convinced to help you in your mission.
6. A rear entrance into the pyramid. An uncanny, smoking sword locked in a magical safe.
7. A large pile of rubble hides a lily-shaped key.
