# Forbidden Sanctum of the Mad Emperor

_For decades the sanctum of the Mad Emperor was considered lost. These days it is badly infested by owls._

1. A scorched ironbound gate on the western wall.
2. A still warm body of a cultist, a stone of blasting nearby.
3. Rations in a crate.
4. A calm pockmarked cleric, lying on the ground.
5. A painting on the wall depicting a scene of wedding.
6. A rear entrance into the sanctum.
7. A reinforced box holds a cursed hammer and a robe.
